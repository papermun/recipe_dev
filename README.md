With this project, I will take my first step into the world of
life changing entrepreneurship. 

First I will implement how to create a basic boilerplate
.html file with considerations for proper charset, meta, title and language.

Then I will work with headings and generating a banner with a locally stored image. I will be able to work with headings of size
h1 to h6

Then I will create a seperate page from the homepage with a list of recipes, with each recipe linking to a separate html file that has it's own title h1 and img

I will also experiment with git commit -m to get used to this nonsensical tool.
