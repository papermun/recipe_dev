    <p>No one knows where Mr Krabs has sourced the meat for his secret patties</p>
    <p>One has to assume it isn't beef , the logistics of transporting beef under the ocean is not realistic</p>
    <p>As such one has to assume the patties are created from plankton</p>

    <ul><strong>List of ingredients</strong>
    <li>Three Kilograms of human corpse</li>
    <li>one human heart</li>
    <li>A cup of Virgin's vaginal fluid</li>

    <li>cuppa earl grey to calm the nerves</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol><strong>Step by step instuction for stupid melei people</strong>
        <p>Feeling stupid because you were born a Malay and has the intellectual capacity of dog shit?</p>
        <p>Well, look no further, this recipe is so simple even the likes of you stupid malays could follow</p>
        <li>Chop up the planktons</li>
        <li>wash the planktons, please don't use the water from the river, you stupid malays shit in the same river</li>
        <li>smush the planktons into a patty</li>
